    <h2>Playing style</h2>
    <p>I have a very practical style and am especially good in technical and strategic positions. I'm also quite an expert at thinking "outside the box".
   Also, I love chess endgames. I'll show you not to fear those "dead draws" and to identify and work with small strategic advantages in all kinds of positions.
   I've been experimenting with a more aggressive and concrete game style for the last few years, so I am a very complete player.</p>

    <h2>Openings</h2>
    <p> I have played a few openings during my career, and nowadays am learning new openings, but I consider myself an expert on:</p>

    </b> 
    <p>I also know, play and have analize other variants like the philidor defense, the Okelly and the Sicilian Classical Variation but my knowledge is not so important.</p>
    <p> If you are interest in looking at my games to see some concrete variants or some of these other openings you can download my public games cliking  <a href="https://www.yottachess.com/player/24510793" class="enlace-invisible">here.</a></p>

    <h2>Endgames</h2>
    <p> I am quite an expert in this area. I understand them at a level way above my rating. 
      I can show you how to understand them well so that you can score exceptionally well in equal positions.
 Controlling this final part of the game is also vital to make informed decisions in the middle game, such as what pieces to exchange or what endgame is more winnable or holdable.</p>
