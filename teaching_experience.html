    <p> I began my coaching journey in 2019 with a boy from Meliana who improved significantly during the year I worked with him. 
      Afterwards, I continued giving masterclasses at clubs and special workshops. 
      In 2024, I took a bigger step into teaching by giving lessons in school extracurricular programs and, especially, at chess clubs. 
      I now have one year of solid experience and I give my best to help my students reach as far as they want to go. </p>
    <p> Some of the experiences of this past years are:</p>
    <dev class="tarjeta-horizontal-amarilla">
        <h2>Certified Level 1 Chess Coach (275h)</h2>
        <p>Taught by the Valencian Chess Federation (and recognised by the Spanish Federation), it has allowed me to refine my teaching methodology and better understand my students. </p>
    </dev>
    <dev class="tarjeta-horizontal-verde">
        <dev>
            <h2> Quart Chess Club</h2>
            <p> Since 2024, the Quart Chess Club has entrusted me the important task of coaching its young talents, with ratings ranging from approximately 1500 to 1800. 
              In our sessions, we work on all aspects of the game, with a special focus on endgames and the study of various pawn structures.
              I've also had the opportunity to accompany the players to several regional underage championships as a coach, gaining valuable experience from this new perspective.            </p>
            <p> All of them improved significantly, although they didn't play many tournaments, so in some cases their current rating doesn't fully reflect their progress. 
              Here are two of the most revealing rating progress graphs.

    <dev class="tarjeta-horizontal-azul">
        <h2>Jugada Torrerífica Chess Club</h2>
        <p>I started right after the club was formed. I taught for a couple of months to a few 7-9-year-olds (with almost no previous chess knowledge) and to a 1800-rated adult. He also helped me improve my teaching skills because he has over 20 years of experience. Unfortunately, we had to stop after the Valencia floods. 
        </p>
        </dev>
    <dev class="tarjeta-horizontal-rojo">
        <h2>Jaque Mate Chess Club</h2>
        <p> This October 2025, I start coaching a group of young players rated between 1800 and 1900 in Torrent. </p>
    </dev>
    <p> I would like to highlight that I have been a young talent. Currently, I am part of the Tecnification program of the Valencian Federation, and I was also part of the Spanish program for a couple of years. During this time, I have received numerous classes from various coaches with different coaching methods, both in personal and group sessions. This experience has allowed me to discern which methods work best in different situations.
       </p> 
      <p>
      Some of the highest rated coaches I've had are: Julen Arizmendi Martínez (2580), Ernesto Fernandez Romero (2511), Alexis Cabrera (2546), Yuriy Kryvoruchko (2717), Alvar Alonso Rosell (2574).
