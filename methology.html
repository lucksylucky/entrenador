    <h2>¿What do I offer?</h2>
    <p>The short answer is: to improve both your understanding of chess and your ability to train yourself successfully. Clases will be interactive, paying special attencion to those topics you can't easily work on your own (as it's explained latter) and guiding you on those you can.</p>
    <p> We'll focus on the reasons behind the moves and we will place a special emphasis in the strategic and practical parts of the game. We will also work the tactics and calculation, but primary as a tool for achieving strategical objectives or converting the advantage inside all the other topics.</p>
    <p> Deserves Special mention:</p>

        <h2> Openings</h2>
            <p> We will work the openings as <b>ideas</b>, avoiding pure memorization as much as possible. 
              The main objective here is to understand the plans, to be able to improvise a little with the move order, to be flexible in that matter. 
              As your level increases, new openings will be explored, trying to match them with structural knowledge.</p>
    </dev>

        <h2> Endgames </h2>
          <p>This phase of the game will get extra focus because, with good guidance, its improvement can result in a very logical and straightforward process. 
            Its domain is vital in the middle-game decision-making, especially regarding pieces or structural changes.</p>
    </dev>

        <h2> Evaluation </h2>
            <p> A good evaluation is more than knowing who's better or worse, it requires knowing whitch elements are positive or negative for our position, and to use this information to focus our move-research.
            </p>
